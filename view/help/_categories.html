<p>Categories are used to organise content into one or many groups.</p>
<h5>List View</h5>
<p>The default page when clicking the Categories tab is a list view. At the top of the page is a Filter, typing text in this input box filters the list below, for example: typing 'ne' will list all items containing the characters 'ne'. Below the the filter is a list of Category items, to the right of each item are the options to 'Edit' and 'Delete'. The Edit button will take you to the Edit Form, clicking the 'Delete' option will ask you to confirm before removing the item.</p>
<h5>Create/Edit View</h5>
<p>Selecting the 'Create New Site Section' or the 'Edit' button next to a list item takes you to the same form.</p>
<p>Available fields are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name:</strong> Name of the category.</li>
	<li><strong>Parent Category:</strong> Categories can be used to create hierarchal structures such as menus.</li>
