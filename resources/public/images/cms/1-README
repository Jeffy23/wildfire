IMPORTANT

The files inside this folder are automatically installed here.
If you make any modifications, or replace the images then you will
very likely lose your work.

If you need to make any changes, do it the right way.

1: Create your own stylesheet and link to the images inside a different folder
   than this one.
   
2: Create your own view, inside your /app/view/ folder to override the ones in the plugin.
   See http://dev.php-wax.com for details of how to do this.
